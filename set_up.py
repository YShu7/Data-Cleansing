        My recommendation? Resolve to take back control of your personal data online. 
        Most people believe that control of their personal data is broken, but don't know what to do to fix it, or worse, think they canâ€™t do anything to fix it. 
        Iâ€™m here to tell you that you can achieve this meaningful resolution through a few quick steps, each of which make a huge difference protecting your privacy: 
        from stopping big tech from sucking up all your browsing data, to adding extra protection to your passwords and email. 
        And, once set up, unlike going to the gym or mastering a new skill, it doesnâ€™t take much effort to maintain.
        So, letâ€™s make 2020 the year we take back our online privacy!

        Step 1. Update your software
