        My recommendation? Resolve to take back control of your personal data online.

        from stopping big tech from sucking up all your browsing data, 
        to adding extra protection to your passwords and email. 
        And, once set up, unlike going to the gym or mastering a new skill, it doesnâ€™t take much effort to maintain.

        To reduce your exposure to these privacy risks, check for updates to your apps and operating systems,
